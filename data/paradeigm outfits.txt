#Epsil Notes: the main themes that I got for the south's new ships are that they are bulky to withstand pirate attacks, modular since many of the designs were converted from civilian ones to speed up development, 


# ANTI-MISSILES
# Based on Zoura's ideas from HSO.
# The south doesn't have any planets that sell anti-missiles separate from ships. While it's not impossible to import things, it makes more sense to me to have them make their own anti-missiles. 
# Epsil Notes: I will retain the Tarazed origin, they will become available when war starts as imports will be cut, giving impetus to the creation of this anti missile.

	description "The inability to purchase Anti-Missile Turrets without heavy import costs means the Southern Defense Pact needed an in-house Anti-Missile system to protect their merchant convoys from pirate attacks. Drawing on the Quarg's long-ranged anti-missile systems, Tarazed's new offering focuses not on delivering as much anti-missile as possible, but firing more accurately over longer ranges."

# WEAPONS
# Before the war, Paradeigm already experimented with weaponry, like the Syndicate, wanting to have a equivalent for the Navy Particle cannon. Unlike the syndicate though they don't have ships large enough to accommodate them, so instead they aim to replace the energy blasters (guns will be somewhat weaker than the Hai pulse cannon but in exchange will have disruption)
#
# Currently they are not very useful against shields that why i have piercing, however the weapons will need balancing to be somewhat useful by themselves.
# In talks with plugin-chat i got the idea to make the Meson a shield disruptor instead of piercer and the Kisat a Hull shredder.

	description "Developed as a replacement for the energy blasters, Meson Phasers were built over the years to be as efficiently as possible. They work by accelerating a packet of protons and electrons trough metal sheets creating an pulsed beam of subatomic particles (new named Phaser Beam) launched at near light speeds. While not very good against any kind of shielding alone, their ability to disrupt them coupled with their small size makes them a lethal weapon in sufficient numbers."

	description "The final development of the Meson Phaser, this Heavy variant pushes the technology even further. After studying the Proton Gun technology from the syndicate, Ikaros developed this variant to be lethal even against the navy ships. Among the upgrades, the Heavy Meson Phaser is capable of disrupting shields even further while increasing damage output by reducing reload time this comes at a cost of doubling the Heat Waste and Energy requirements.
