		log "Factions" "Borderworlds" `The Borderworlds are a section of space that has historically been outside the Earth influence for a long time. while this Region of space is plagued by corruption and piracy it also had made advances in various fields despite that. with the Formation of the Free worlds, the borderlands agreed to join as many depend on the resources the rim has to continue their economy.`
		conversation
			`As you pass through the spaceport somenthing catches your attention, a group near another video screen in the local bar.`
			`	The scene is of a large government hall, where an important looking man is standing before a crowd, It seems to be announcing something, "... and for those reasons we decided that regardless of the doubts casted by the attacks to Geminus and Martini. We will continue to advocate for the reformation of the election of planetary representatives and reevaluation of all existing trade tariffs, until then we will continue to support the Free Worlds on their Cause. `
			`	the Bar is filled with chatter many discussing what has transpired, "First the Rim now the Borderworlds, how can things gets worse." you watch quietly until the group disperses, then you depart to your ship once again.`
