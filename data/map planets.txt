	description "Phenyria is an earth-like world orbiting Alniyat, however the planet is in the far edge of its habitable zone making its climate very Earth-Like although much colder even on the equator, despite this Phenyria is home for one-point-five hundred million people from all regions of space and thanks to its vast resources, its a major industrial and scientific hub in the South. "
	description "The largest industries in the planet include Paradeigm Group who employ a tenth of the worlds population, and Ikaros Engineering who's headquarters reside on Ilmyria and develop all kinds of outfits."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located inside the main city near the government house, and is divided into two sections called rings. The innermost ring is the oldest, built when the planet was first discovered it was the end point to various caravans however it isn't capable of handling most modern freighters of today and its used for smaller star ships, the oldest facilities were closed off are being currently converted into a museum. The outermost ring, built 100 years ago, is one of the largest spaceports in the South, handling everything from food convoys to shipbuilding parts."
	spaceport "Slightly outside the spaceport there is a smaller port owned by Paradigm that handles all sorts of equipment, occasionally you can see bright flashes inside one of the hangars but you cant make heads or tails of what is it."

	description "Ilmyria is the first moon of Phenyria and the only one that is habitable for humans. In the early days of the South, Ilmyria was used as a stopgap for repairing ships in long hauls. As things quiet down the moon settlement found new life as a tourist destination and education home especially for the increasing middle class of the Dirt Belt and beyond. As such more than half of its residents are off-world students. Today the moon is home to various ski resorts, mountain climbing and winter homes courtesy of the government who provides substantial benefits to workers as well as large universities which attract many to learn."
	spaceport "Although not outdated in any sense, the spaceport has a distinctive vintage style from the early days of exploration. The main terminal is littered with advertisements for many resorts and schools in the zone and many buses come and go from the terminal. The port is located some kilometers of the main settlement which resembles the alpine villages that you would see on some movies. Just outside the the village there is a large education campus where many students qualify for the many industries in the system."

	description "While it was ignored for most of of the System history, when Caravans arrived, there was a qualitative jump in industrial capacity, to the point that a new attempt was made to colonize Nymbu. To do this a new type of Colony ship, the Cloud City, was constructed, the first and only one being established here."
	description "Nymbu is also famous for hosting the Strato GX a racing competition across the planet."
	spaceport "The Port is a spire structure located in the center of city, where ships dock and take off regularly, at the center is a elevator that takes you to the more recreational, commercial and business areas. Larger ships enter at the base where it has more space and some don't even land, just dump their cargo for the drones to unload it and take off again. There is even some who are using the upper floors to do attempt some sky gliding, a popular sport in this cloudy world."

Its first settlers, wanting to escape the crowdedness that plagued Earth, scattered across the continent, and established thousands of small independent villages instead of large cities that are more common elsewhere."
	description "Being an idyllic agrarian world, Austral is a popular retirement destination, with a population number reaching a hundred million recently. Due to the planetâ€™s remoteness and the decentralized nature of settlements, most Austral villages are not shown on maps. This makes Austral a perfect hideout for wanted individuals across the galaxy, who wish to disappear among the numerous uncatalogued settlements in the middle of the vast continent."

	description "The loss of trade during the 25th century forced Earth to find a new breadbasket for its unparalleled population, prompting the development of greenhouses away from crowded Earth. Escaping famine, Mars received millions of settlers from Earth to set up a new life as farmers in the greenhouses. Successive terraforming efforts has made Mars more habitable and suitable for farming."
	description "Mars was the headquarters of the Republic Navy, until Geminus took that position."
	spaceport "The spaceport on Mars is situated in the southern hemisphere next to a vast inland sea. the Port itself looks very utilitarian, with vast entrances that connect underground while the surface reserved for the cargo vessels. Large electric carts take and load containers 24/7."
	spaceport "In the hub, you can tell that this place has much history, large historical recounts adorn the walls with events stretching back to the first settlers of this planet. The bar looks even more ancient, with many personnel coming to pass the nights before their next assignment."

But with the dawn of the space age, many organizations focused on making the planet a second home for humans because its Earth-like characteristics. After half a millennia of work, the planet became safe to inhabit, but the atmosphere is still unbreathable without the assistance of respirators."
	description `Since the formation of the Republic, Venus became home to the Interplanetary Court of Justice and also the Republic Intelligence Bureau. Venus is also known as the "Garden of the Republic" with its Biospheres crafted to absolute perfection, to the delight of tourists and locals alike. `
	spaceport "Unlike Earth's spaceport the one in Venus is a tall structure that extends to the clouds by tall skyscrapers connected by bridges. Everything inside the structure has a garden like aesthetic and its surprisingly clean for such a busy spaceport. "
	spaceport "Tourists are seen admiring the gardens in the balconies and many starships come and go taking passengers around the massive structure. In the distance you spot another spaceport, most likely for Navy and or Government. There's a series of elevators that connect to multiple MagLev stations which themselves connect to the ever growing network of urban settlements."

The day interstellar commerce broke down, food became more scarc and the population suffered famines resulting in overproduction ravaging the planet, an exodus ocurred and the cities became desolated. "
	description "When trade resumed again population normalized, however measures to make sure the tragedy never repeated led to the construction of large towers that house aquoponic farms for meat and other vegetables, today those towers became simbolic of the Human ability to adapt to the challenges and recieve many visitors."

	description "New Guangdong is an ocean world almost devoid of landmasses. The first settlers that came here started in small fishing villages and outpost on the few islands that went above the surface. As industrialization took hold, the villages expanded into floating cities large enough to dwarf any metropolis on earth allowing it to diversify its economy. Thanks to the discovery of massive silicon deposits, a local electronics industry was established and the cities exploded in population."
	description "Today almost all electronics utilized in Human space use components fabricated here making this a hub for merchants from all corners of space."
	spaceport "The spaceport can be described in one word: 'Massive', the main platform is at least seven kilometers in diameter and surrounding it are smaller platforms capable of taking multiple bulk freighters at the same time. You can see the cargo being unloaded from the spaceships and moved by automatic loaders to titanic ships that depart to factories all across the ocean."
	spaceport " The Hub of the port can be considered a city unto itself, you can estimate hundreds of thousands of people transiting the area every hour. From large shopping centers to casinos and hotels one could travel all and still have the rest of the planet to see."

The last planet settled by the Hindu people, its an hospitable climate, but the amount of labor needed to clear forests and to plow rocky fields has meant that the towns here can only grow very slowly."
	description "The farms grow both food crops and cotton, and very recently they have begun manufacturing their own textiles instead of just shipping the raw cotton off-world for processing."
	spaceport "Asrayapur's spaceport is a ring of low wooden buildings around a wide landing area paved with concrete slabs. Around the perimeter carts of trade goods are driven, some being pulled by tractors and others, by horses or oxen. You even think you see a few carts being pulled by water buffalo."
