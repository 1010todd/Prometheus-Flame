As to be expected, the planet's supplies are running dangerously low, and what remains of Martini's government has called for civilian ships to help deliver goods and provisions for the operation.`
		spaceport `Instead of the immaculate spaceport that Martini once sported, this temporary spaceport consists of randomly-scattered makeshift landing areas, in order to support the large number of Navy and civilian ships assisting with the rescue and evacuation operation.`

	planet "New Guangdong"
		description "New Guangdong is an ocean world almost devoid of landmasses. The first settlers that came here started in small fishing villages and outpost on the few islands that went above the surface. As industrialization took hold, the villages expanded into floating cities large enough to dwarf any metropolis on earth allowing it to diversify its economy. Thanks to the discovery of massive silicon deposits, a local electronics industry was established and the cities exploded in population."
		description "Ever since the attack to the Starport is slowly sinking, thousands of ships and starcraft have been used to evacuate the port. with ships moving away to not be swallowed by the former starport. The nuclear blast also created a massive tsunami that struck cities on the other side of the planet so an evacuation order was sent by the central government to Neighboring New Sichuan."
		spaceport "Whats left of the starport is a mess, with the crater left by the blast sinking the whole structure, you can still see some navy ships entering the structure to try and save the people trapped here. more merchant vessels land in the smaller pads still functioning to take the survivors off-world."

	planet "Bourne"
		description `Bourne is a well-developed industrial world that was first settled four centuries ago. Its cities are home to some of the richest individuals in this section of the galaxy, but also home to tens of thousands of homeless people, and many others whose factory jobs are barely providing enough to make ends meet.`
		description `	Outside the cities, the climate is somewhat dry, but the deep valleys and some coastal regions are suitable for farming. Very little of the planet remains that is untouched by human hands.`
		description `	Bourne is also the seat of government for the newly formed Free Worlds.`

We will continue to advocate for the reformation of the election of planetary representatives and reevaluation of all existing trade tariffs, until then we will continue to support the Free Worlds on their Cause. `
